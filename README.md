# OTPAnalyzer

A Flutter app for analyzing OTPs that I get on my phone.

This is a continuation of my experiments with using LLMs for writing code and 
developing software. I tried using ChatGPT, but it's output "did'nt work", so I 
switched to Claude -- which was amazing. There were a few build issues that
would have taken me a ton of time to figure out and fix (and wouldn't have 
helped me learn anything on the way), which were easily fixed by Claude.
